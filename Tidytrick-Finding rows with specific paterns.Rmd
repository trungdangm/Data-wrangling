```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Checking rows with a specific pattern

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)
```

```{r}
adult <- read_csv("adultincome.csv")
```

We are looking for the total number of rows containing the patter '?'

```{r}
missing_count_tbl <- purrr::map_df(adult, ~ stringr::str_detect(., pattern = "\\?")) %>%
  rowSums() %>%
  tbl_df() %>%
  filter(value > 0) %>%
  summarize(missing_count = n()) 

missing_count_tbl
```
In the data, there are 2399 rows that contain the pattern "?".

To locate columns that have this pattern

```{r}
count.NA.percolumn <- plyr::ldply(adult, function(c) sum(c == "?"))
count.NA.percolumn
``` 

There are 3 columns that contain "?" as NA: workclass, occupation, and native.country.
